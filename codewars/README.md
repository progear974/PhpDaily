# Kyu/Dan Ranks

<img align="left" width="130" height="300" src="https://github.com/progear974/CppDaily/blob/master/CodeWars/kyu.png?raw=true">
Each kata on the site is set to a Kyu/Dan rank, based on its subject area and difficulty. The community collectively determines rank in the Beta Process. Every new Codewarrior (user) on Codewars starts being ranked as 8 Kyu.

What are Kyu and Dan? The terms are borrowed from a system in Japanese martial arts, which is in turn borrowed from the game of Go. Kyu indicates the number of degrees away from master level (Dan). This is why they count downward. Once you reach master level, we count upward.

Currently Dan level content is reserved for later. You will only find Kyu level content to train on for now.
